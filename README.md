# History
Google history is awful. I will do better.

Should either replace Ctrl+H in chrome/or add another hotkey.

When pressing Ctrl+H in my browser, I instead want a page to show up with all of my database stored (locally on my machine) search history. I want to use my own "Google Browser History" instead.
